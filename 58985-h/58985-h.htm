  <h2 class='c008'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c011'>NEARLY forty years ago, Dr. Furnivall collected
for the Early English Text Society “divers
treatises touching the Manners and Meals of Englishmen
in former days.” Some of these were published in
1868, under the title <i>The Babees’ Book</i>,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a> and others,
chiefly of later date, in 1869, under the title <i>Queene
Elizabethes Achademy</i>.</p>

<p class='c001'>These two volumes, with their introductions and
illustrative matter, to my mind present the most vivid
picture of home life in medieval England that we
have. Aside from their general human interest, they
are valuable to the student of social history, and almost
essential to an understanding of the literature of their
time. The whole fabric of the romances was based
upon the intricate system of “courtesy” as here set
forth, and John Russell furnishes an interesting comment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>on Chaucer and his school, as do Rhodes and
Seager and Weste on the writers of the sixteenth
century. Finally, among these treatises, there is many
a plum by the way for the seeker of proverbs, curious
lore, superstitions, literary oddities. And as comparatively
few people have time or inclination to worry
through antiquated English, Dr. Furnivall has long
wished that the substance of his collections might
be presented in modern form. Therefore this little
volume has been undertaken.</p>

<p class='c001'>Doubtless unwritten codes of behaviour are coeval
with society; but the earliest treatises that we possess
emphasize morals rather than manners. Even the late
Latin author known as Dionysius Cato (fourth century?),
whose maxims were constantly quoted, translated,
imitated, and finally printed during the late
Middle Ages, does not touch upon the niceties of conduct
that we call manners; wherefore one John Garland,
an Englishman educated at Oxford, who lived
much in France during the first half of the thirteenth
century, felt bound to supplement Cato on these
points. His work, entitled <i>Liber Faceti: docens mores
hominum, precipue iuuenum, in supplementum illorum qui
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>a moralissimo Cathone erant omissi iuuenibus utiles</i>,<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c012'><sup>[2]</sup></a> is
alluded to as <i>Facet</i> in the first piece in this volume,
and serves as basis for part of the <i>Book of Courtesy</i>.</p>

<p class='c001'>But, earlier than this, Thomasin of Zerklaere, about
1215, wrote in German a detailed treatise on manners
called <i>Der Wälsche Gast</i>.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c012'><sup>[3]</sup></a> And in 1265, Dante’s
teacher, Brunetto Latini, published his <i>Tesoretto</i>,<a href='#f3' class='c012'><sup>[3]</sup></a>
which was soon followed by a number of similar
treatises in Italian.</p>

<p class='c001'>While we need not hold with the writer of the <i>Little
Children’s Little Book</i>, that courtesy came down from
heaven when Gabriel greeted the Virgin, and Mary
and Elizabeth met, we must look for its origin somewhere;
and inasmuch as, in its medieval form at least,
it is closely associated with the practices of chivalry, we
may not unreasonably suppose it to have appeared first
in France. And although most of the extant French
treatises belong to the fourteenth or fifteenth centuries,
a lost book of courtesy, translated by Thomasin of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>Zerklaere, is sometimes held, on good grounds, to have
been derived from French, rather than from Italian.</p>

<p class='c001'>In any case, such of the English books as were not
taken immediately from Latin, came from French
sources. To be sure, there is a Saxon poem, based it
would seem on Cato, though by no means a translation,
called <i>A Father’s Instructions to his Son</i>; but this,
although it is greatly exercised about the child’s soul,
takes no thought for his finger-nails or his nose.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is not, therefore, surprising to find that nearly all
English words denoting manners are of French origin—<i>courtesy</i>,
<i>villainy</i>, <i>nurture</i>, <i>dignity</i>, <i>etiquette</i>, <i>debonaire</i>,
<i>gracious</i>, <i>polite</i>, <i>gentilesse</i>, &amp;c., while to balance them I
can, at this moment, recall only three of Saxon origin—<i>thew</i>
(which belongs rather to the list of moral words
in which Old English abounds), <i>churlish</i> and <i>wanton</i>
(without breeding), both of which, significantly enough,
are negative of good manners.</p>

<p class='c001'>The reason for the predominance of the French
terms is simply that “French use these gentlemen,” as
one old writer puts it; that is, from the Conquest until
the latter part of the fourteenth century the language
of the invaders prevailed almost entirely among the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>upper classes, who, accordingly, learned their politeness
out of French or Latin books; and it was only with the
growth of citizenship and English together, that these
matters came to be discussed in this latter tongue for
the profit of middle-class children, as well as of the
“bele babees” at Court.</p>

<p class='c001'>We must suppose, from numerous hints and descriptions,
that an elaborate system of manners and customs
prevailed long before it was codified. The Bayeux
tapestry (eleventh century) shows a feast, with a server
kneeling to serve, his napkin about his neck, as John
Russell prescribes some four hundred years later.</p>

<p class='c001'>The romances again, alike in French and in English,
describe elaborate ceremonies, and allude constantly to
definite laws of courtesy. Now and again we find a
passage that sets forth the ideal gentleman. Young
Horn, for example, was taught “skill of wood and
river” (hunting and hawking), carving, cup-bearing,
and harping “with his nails sharp.” Child Florent
showed his high birth by his love of horse, hawk, and
armour, and by his contempt of gold; but he was not
thought ill-mannered to laugh when his foster-father
and mother fell down in their attempt to draw a rusty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span>sword from its scabbard! Chaucer’s <i>Squire</i> might
well have been brought up on a treatise similar to those
included in this volume:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Well could he sit on horse and fairly ride;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He could songs make and fair could he indite,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Joust and eke dance, and well portray and write.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in5'>────────────────</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in1'>Courteous he was, lowly, and serviceáble,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And carved before his father at the table.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But the <i>Prioress</i> outmatched him, having possibly
learned her manners in the French of “Stratford-atte-Bowe,”
in <i>Les Contenances de la Table</i>, or some such
thing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“At meatë well y-taught was she withal,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>She let no morsel from her lippës fall,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Nor wet her fingers in her saucë deep:</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Well could she carry a morsel, and well keep,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>That no dropë did fall upon her breast;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>In courtesy was set full much her lest.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c012'><sup>[4]</sup></a></div>
      <div class='line in1'>Her over-lippë wipéd she so clean,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>That in her cup there was no farthing seen</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Of grease, when she drunken had her draught.</div>
      <div class='line in1'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xvii'>xvii</span>Full seemëly after her meat she raught,<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c012'><sup>[5]</sup></a></div>
      <div class='line in1'>And certainly she was of great desport,<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c012'><sup>[6]</sup></a></div>
      <div class='line in1'>And full pleasant, and amiable of port;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And painéd her to counterfeitë cheer</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Of court, and to be stately in mannér,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And to be holden digne of reverence.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>These maxims were versified that they might be the
more easily remembered, as we know from various expressions,
notably “Learn or be Lewd” (ignorant),
which occurs at the end of several pieces. In 1612 the
principle was stated explicitly, “because children will
learn that book with most readiness and delight through
the running of the metre, as it is found by experience.”
And the fact that versified treatises on manners formed
part of the schooling of that day, brings up the subject
of medieval education.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the first place, this cannot be understood until we
have set aside our modern ideas of master and servant.
The old point of view is picturesquely summed up in a
pamphlet of 1598, quoted by Dr. Furnivall.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Amongst what sort of people should then this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>serving-man be sought for? Even the duke’s son
preferred page to the prince, the earl’s second son
attendant upon the duke, the knight’s second son the
earl’s servant, the esquire’s son to wear the knight’s
livery, and the gentleman’s son the esquire’s serving-man.
Yea, I know at this day gentlemen, younger
brothers that wear their elder brother’s blue coat and
badge, attending him with as reverent regard and dutiful
obedience as if he were their prince or sovereign.
Where was then in the prime of this profession Goodman
Tomson’s Jack, or Robin Rush, my Gaffer Russet-coat’s
second son? The one holding the plough, the
other whipping the cart-horse, labouring like honest
men in their vocation. Trick Tom the tailer was then
a tiler for this trade; as strange to find a blue coat on
his back, with a badge on his sleeve, as to take Kent
Street without a scold, or Newmarket Heath without
a highwayman. But now, being lapped in his livery,
he thinketh himself as good a man, with the shears at
his back, as the Poet Laureate with a pen in his ear.”</p>

<p class='c001'>From this passage it is clear that at a time not very
much earlier, serving was a profession in which every
rank, except royalty itself (if indeed this is to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xix'>xix</span>omitted, see pp. 1, 179 below), might honourably wear
the livery of a man of higher rank. Indeed, under the
system of entail, this was, in time of peace, the only
possible livelihood for a gentleman’s younger son, unless
he had a special aptitude for law or the Church.
Debarred from all trade, he could only offer his services
to some great man who was compelled by his estate to
keep up a large household, and so earn his patronage to
provide for the future. It was fully expected that boys
so placed would be helped to opportunities at Court
or abroad, and girls to good marriages. That these
patrons really took an interest in their young servitors,
and felt responsible for their welfare, appears in many
accounts of help bestowed upon men who afterwards
became famous in literature, or scholarship, or state-craft.
And as for the girls, Dr. Furnivall quotes an
amusing instance of a mistress who, when reproached
with dismissing a gentlewoman without due cause,
thereby injuring her chances for the future, immediately
allowed her forty shillings a year towards her
maintenance while she herself lived.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among rich men it was the custom to receive a
number of boys for training in this way. In the household
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xx'>xx</span>of Lord Percy there were nine young “henchmen”
who served him as cup-bearers and in various
other capacities. To these he allowed servants, one
for each two, unless they were “at their friends’ finding,”
in which case they might have one apiece.
Likewise, in his household, his second son was carver,
his third, sewer.</p>

<p class='c001'>But while in a rich man’s household, younger sons
might receive as good a training as if they had been sent
elsewhere for the purpose, the case of the younger sons
of a poor gentleman might be sufficiently wretched.
Orlando, in <i>As You Like It</i>, speaks feelingly on this
point. Although his father had left 1000 crowns for
his upbringing, he was so neglected that he says: “His
(his brother’s) horses are bred better, for, besides that
they are fair with their feeding, they are taught their
manage, and to that end riders dearly hired;<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c012'><sup>[7]</sup></a> but I,
his brother, gain nothing under him but growth ...
he lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxi'>xxi</span>brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility
with my education.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The alternative to such a life of hardship was either
to enter the Church or depend upon its charity, or to
serve in the household of a man of rank. While only a
few were fitted for the religious life or cared to undertake
it, “many poor gentlemen ... left beggars in
consequence of the inheritance devolving to the eldest
son,” were supported by the charity of the Church, as
we are told by an Italian visitor to England in 1496-7.</p>

<p class='c001'>The case of an unmarried daughter living at home,
though less desperate, was even in well-to-do families
sufficiently uncomfortable, as is plainly hinted in a
letter written by Margaret Paston to her husband in
1469. She implores him to find his sister “some
worshipful place,” and concludes: “I will help to her
finding, for we be either of us weary of other.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The practice of sending children seven or eight years
old away from their parents was ostensibly that they
“might learn better manners”; but the Italian
visitor mentioned above concluded uncharitably that
the real reason was, the English had but small affection
for their children, and liked to keep all their comforts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxii'>xxii</span>to themselves, and moreover knew that they would be
“better served by strangers than by their own children.”
However absurd this may seem at first glance,
I incline to think that the foreigner may have touched
upon truth here, as is borne out by many instances of
Spartan, even brutal, treatment of children by parents
in those days. Still, the fact remains that the loss of
home life and parental tenderness was balanced by
gain in discipline, education, social opportunity, and
the opening up of careers.</p>

<p class='c001'>The education of the various children addressed in
these treatises varied according to their social status.
As early as the twelfth century certainly, and perhaps
earlier, it was customary for “bele babees,” with boys
and girls, to have a tutor either at home, or in the household
of the great man with whom they were placed.
If they went to school, there were at first the monastic
and conventual institutions; then later, the universities
and grammar-schools. But, in the case of
girls like the <i>Good Wife’s</i> daughter, who sold homespun
in the market-place, and had to be admonished
not to get drunk often, I doubt whether there would
be any education beyond her mother’s teaching.</p>

<p class='c001'>The universities, at first, were frequented chiefly by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiii'>xxiii</span>poor men’s sons, and scarcely attended by the upper
classes. In Chaucer’s time, the <i>Clerk of Oxenford</i> was
lean and threadbare, and had but little gold, and his
two Cambridge scholars were in no better case. Nearly
two centuries later, Sir Thomas More says: “Then
may we yet like poor scholars of Oxford, go a-begging
with our bags and wallets, and sing ‘<i>Salve, Regina</i>’” (a
carol) “at rich men’s doors.” However, gradually
during the sixteenth century, a university education
became so fashionable that rich men’s sons crowded in,
and “scrooged” (I quote Dr. Furnivall) poor students
out of the proceeds of endowments left expressly for
them. Still, in 1517, the old ideal of a gentleman as
yet held its own, as is amusingly related by Pace in his
<i>De Fructu</i>. He tells how “one of those whom we call
gentlemen, who always carry some horn hanging at
their backs, as though they would hunt during dinner,
said: ‘I swear by God’s body I would rather that my
son should hang than study letters. For it becomes the
sons of gentlemen to blow the horn nicely, and to hunt
skilfully, and elegantly carry and train a hawk. But
the study of letters should be left to the sons of
rustics....’”</p>

<p class='c001'>But Pace was equal to him. “You do not seem to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiv'>xxiv</span>me to think aright, good man,” said I, “for if any
foreigner were to come to the king, such as are ambassadors
of princes, and an answer had to be given to him,
your son if he were educated as you wish, could only
blow his horn, and the learned sons of rustics would be
called to answer, and they would be far preferred to
your hunter or fowler son,” &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fashion among noblemen of sending their sons
abroad to study, either at a university or with a tutor,
did not prevail widely until later. In the twelfth
century, indeed, the “English nation” was famous at
the University of Paris, but was composed largely of
poor but earnest students, some of whom became
famous men; and even these had ceased to study there
before the fifteenth century.</p>

<p class='c001'>Younger sons of good birth, in the service of a man
of rank, were usually taught by a “maistyr” or tutor
in the household in which they were placed. It is only
in later books like Seager’s that these rules of demeanour
were applied extensively to schoolboys. Doubtless
gentlemen’s sons went to Winchester (after 1373) and
to Eton (after 1440); but of the thirty grammar-schools
endowed before 1500, all the others were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxv'>xxv</span>attended chiefly by the middle classes. The early
monastic schools doubtless entertained young noblemen;
but the cathedral schools founded by Henry VIII.
seem to have been for citizens’ children, such as the
boy in Symon’s <i>Lesson of Wisdom</i>, who is urged to learn
fast so that when the old bishop dies he may be ready
to take his place. However, even earlier we find complaints
of the monastic schools which helped each shoemaker
to educate his son, and each beggar’s brat to be
a writer and finally a bishop, so that lords’ sons must
kneel to him.</p>

<p class='c001'>In general, the system of education implied in the
<i>Babees’ Book</i> is that described in the household ordinances
of Edward IV. for the young henchmen in
charge of a “maistyr,” who should teach them to ride
cleanly and surely, to draw them also to jousts, to ...
“wear their harness, to have all courtesy in words, deeds,
and degrees, diligently to keep them in rules of goings
and sittings, after they be of honour.” They learned
also “sundry languages,” and harping, piping, singing
and dancing. Likewise, their master sat always with
them at table in the hall, to see “how mannerly they eat
and drink, and to their communication and other forms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvi'>xxvi</span>of court, after the book of <i>Urbanitie</i><a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c012'><sup>[8]</sup></a>.” Clearly it would
seem that one of the very treatises in this collection
was studied by these young pages of Edward IV.</p>

<p class='c001'>What languages they learned and what else studied
we are not told in detail; but in Henry VIII.’s time,
young Gregory Cromwell, son of the Earl of Essex,
studied French, writing, fencing, “casting accounts,”
instrumental music, &amp;c. He was also made to read
English aloud for the pronunciation, and was taught
the etymology of Latin and French words. His day
was as follows: After Mass, he read first the Colloquium
on <i>Pietas Puerilis</i> (<i>De Civilitate Morum Puerilium</i>)
by Erasmus (written 1530), of which he had
to practice the precepts. Now this is nothing
more than a collection of maxims similar to the
<i>Facet</i> mentioned in the <i>Babees’ Book</i>, together with
learned <i>Scholia</i> in Latin and Greek; hence, he had
the same kind of thing to learn—only more elaborate—as
the boys mentioned a hundred years earlier studied
in <i>Urbanitie</i>. Doubtless his master approved the beginning
of Erasmus: “Est autem uel prima uirtutis
ac honestatis pars, tenere præcepta de moribus.” The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvii'>xxvii</span>specific nature of these directions appears in the
following:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Cleanliness of teeth must be cared for, but to
whiten them with powder does for girls. To rub the
gum with salt or alum is injurious.... If anything
sticks to the teeth, you must get it out, not with a
knife, or with your nails after the manner of dogs and
cats, or with your napkin, but with a toothpick, or
quill or small bone taken from the tibias of cocks or
hens. To wash the mouth in the morning with pure
water is both mannerly and healthful; to do it often is
foolish.” Indeed, Erasmus’s treatise is only a superior
book of courtesy.</p>

<p class='c001'>His manners attended to, young Gregory wrote for
one or two hours, read Fabyan’s <i>Chronicle</i>, and gave
the rest of the day to his lute and virginals. When he
rode, his master used to tell him stories of the Greeks
and Romans, which he had to repeat; and his recreations
were hunting, hawking and shooting with the
long bow.</p>

<p class='c001'>A harsher system prevailed with Queen Elizabeth’s
wards, according to Sir Nicholas Bacon. They went
to church at 6 o’clock, studied Latin until 11, dined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxviii'>xxviii</span>from 11 to 12, had music from 12 to 2, French from
2 to 3, Latin and Greek from 3 to 5, then prayers,
supper, and “honest pastimes” until 8, then music
until 9, and so to bed.</p>

<p class='c001'>The curricula in these various schools doubtless
emphasized the usual Latin subjects (Greek was not
taught in England before 1500) of the Middle Ages.
Thus we find an account of the “disputations” in a
London grammar-school, dating from 1174. But
that athletic sports were popular even at that early
time, appears from the same narrative, in which we
read of football, sham fights, water-quintain, archery,
running, leaping, wrestling, stone-casting, flinging
bucklers, sliding and skating (on bones), besides the
brutal sports of hog-, boar- and cock-fighting, bull- and
bear-baiting.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the other extreme we find the account of a
school-day in 1612. Work begins at 6, and those who
come first have the best places. At 9 o’clock,
there is given 15 minutes for breakfast and recreation;
then work continues until 11 or past (to balance the
15 minutes off). Dinner follows, and then work until
3 or 3.30, then 15 minutes off, and work until 5.30,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxix'>xxix</span>when school closes with a piece of a chapter, two
staves of a psalm and prayer by the master.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is probable, however, that these two descriptions
are but two sides of the same medal; that Fitzstephen’s
holidays were balanced by work days as tedious as those
described by Brinsley.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c012'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>A singular fact to be noted in the English courtesy
books is the almost complete absence of allusions to
women. Barring the <i>Good Wife</i> and <i>Wise Man</i>, which
are distinctly middle class in tone, we have practically
nothing to represent the elaborate directions for conduct
in some of the foreign treatises. Yet it cannot be
doubted that the English system of patronage led to
social problems and rules for the demeanour of young
men and women together, such as prevailed abroad.
Undoubtedly, too, the association of a lord’s pages and
a lady’s maidens must have furthered the arrangement
of marriages, perhaps not always in the way desired.
Take, for example, the case of Anne Boleyn. After
seven years’ service with the royal ladies of France, she
came home and was placed in the household of Queen
Katharine. Meanwhile, there was attendant upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxx'>xxx</span>Cardinal Wolsey a certain young Lord Percy, who,
whenever his master was with the king, would “resort
for pastime into the queen’s chamber, and there would
fall in dalliance among the queen’s maidens.” In the
end, he and Mistress Anne were secretly troth-plight;
but Wolsey discovered the arrangement and sent the
girl home, whereat she “smoked” (we say <i>fumed</i>) until
she was recalled and heard of the great love the king
bore her “in the bottom of his stomach”; then she
“began to look very hault and stout, having all manner
of jewels or rich apparel that might be gotten for
money.” And doubtless there are many other similar
complications to be found among old records, and
more have perished, or were never written down
at all.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is something of a shock to turn from the elaborate
rules for carving and serving, as set forth by Russell and
others, to the domestic records of the time. The
mingled splendour and squalor of the Middle Ages
almost passes belief. We read of priceless hangings
and costumes that cost each a small fortune, yet
Erasmus describes the floors in noblemen’s houses as
sometimes encumbered with refuse for twenty years
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxi'>xxxi</span>together.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c012'><sup>[10]</sup></a> King Edward IV. was provided with a
barber who shaved him once a week, and washed his
head, feet, and legs, <i>if</i> he so desired. A proper bath,
according to Russell, seems to have been an event to
be heralded with flowers and resorted to chiefly as
curative. We see to-day the splendid palaces and
castles, such as Hampton Court and Windsor, Knole
and Penshurst and Warwick, built by kings and
noblemen, and yet Henry VIII had to enact a law
against the filthy condition of the servants in his own
kitchen, and Wolsey, passing through the suitors in
Westminster Hall, carried disinfectants concealed in
an orange. It is this contrast in manners, doubtless,
which will first strike the reader. A young nobleman
had to be instructed not only how to hold his carving-knife
with a thumb and two fingers, but also not to
dip his meat into the salt-cellar, or lick the dust out of
dish with his tongue, or wipe his nose on the table-cloth;
and other instructions were added too primitive
for translation. Undoubtedly, the general impression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxii'>xxxii</span>that one derives is, as Dr. Furnivall puts it, of
“dirty, ill-mannered, awkward young gawks,” whose
“maistyrs” were greatly to be pitied. But, on the
whole, it is surprising to note how little the fundamental
bases of good manners have altered. Though
we are not to-day so plain-spoken, our ideals are
similar to those of our ancestors, but theirs was the
greater difficulty of attainment. Personal cleanliness,
self-respect, reverence to one’s better, and consideration
for one’s neighbour seem to have been then as they are
now, the foundation-stones.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, it is interesting to notice the
development of manners with improved conditions of
life. One code was altered with the introduction of
the handkerchief, another with the use of the fork (apparently
first mentioned in 1463, but not common until
after 1600, though it had long been in use on the Continent),
and so on, so that by degrees social expedients
and ceremonies change, while essentials remain.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of each of the pieces here included I give a brief
account in the notes. Needless to say, they form only
a small portion of an enormous practical literature,
though they are fairly representative of the English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxiii'>xxxiii</span>branch of it, for the time that they cover. In order to
bring even so much within the compass of this small
volume, it has been found necessary to condense. The
principle of condensation has been as follows: whenever
a text is particularly wordy for the matter that it
contains, or has been found difficult to reproduce in
modern language in the old verse-form, it has been
done simply into prose. In cases where the metrical
form has been preserved, perhaps both rhythm and
rhyme have suffered in the translation; but in no
instance has there been any poetic beauty lost, for the
plain reason that the literary value of these productions
is nil. In addition to a few omissions on grounds
of taste, I have put aside various recipes and dietaries,
hoping to use them later in a book devoted entirely to
that sort of thing; and for the same reason, I have
omitted considerable portions of Russell’s work, in
which he deals with the dietetic properties and values
of different kinds of food, describes various sorts of
wines, enters into the details of carving fish, flesh, and
fowl, and sets forth numerous recipes and elaborate
menus. It is all interesting but has little to do
with manners. Likewise, I have omitted Wynkyn de
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxiv'>xxxiv</span>Worde’s <i>Book of Carving</i>, which seems to be only a
prose version of Russell, portions of Rhodes’s work
which deal rather with professional serving-men, and
of Seager’s and West’s books, which treat of morals
rather than manners. Further, I have omitted the
various Latin and French poems on the subject, and
a number of odds and ends of a generally didactic
character, which, it seemed, could be best spared.</p>

<p class='c001'>In translating, I have tried to keep as much as
possible the quaint flavour of the originals, especially in
the case of those rendered into modern English in the
verse form. To that end I have retained old words
and constructions whenever they seemed intelligible,
although eccentric and perhaps ungrammatical to-day.
When an archaic word alone conveyed the exact meaning,
or was especially picturesque, I have left it, with
a gloss at the bottom of the page, where also I refer to
notes at the end, on points which seem to require
special elucidation. My aim throughout has been to
make the texts clear with the minimum of alteration.
Doubtless I could have improved the metre frequently
by merely a change in order of words; but I thought
it better to meddle as little as possible, except for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxv'>xxxv</span>sake of clearness; and so the verse often bumps along
cheerfully, regardless of rhythm, style, and grammar.
I think I may claim that in substance the modernised
<i>Babees’ Book</i> is as near as possible to its original.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>THE BABEES’ BOOK<br /> <br /><span class='c014'>OR</span><br /> <br />A LITTLE REPORT OF HOW YOUNG PEOPLE SHOULD BEHAVE</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c011'>MAY He who formed mankind in His image,
support me while I turn this treatise out of
Latin into my common language, that through this
little comment all of tender years may receive instruction
in courtesy and virtue.</p>

<p class='c001'>Facet<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c012'><sup>[11]</sup></a> saith that the Book of Courtesy to teach the
practice of virtue is the most helpful thing in the world,
so I will not shrink from this labour or refuse it; but
for mine own learning will say something that touches
upon the matter.</p>

<p class='c001'>But oh, young babies, whom blood royal hath endowed
with grace, comeliness, and high ability, it is on
you I call to know this book, for it were great pity but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>that ye added to sovereign beauty virtue and good
manners. Therefore I speak to you specially, and not
to old men expert in governance, decorum, and honest
manners, for what need is to give pangs to Hell, joy
to Heaven, water to the sea, or heat to fire already hot?</p>

<p class='c001'>And so, young babies,<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c012'><sup>[12]</sup></a> my book is only for your instruction;
wherefore I pray that no man reprehend it,
but amend it where it is at fault, and judge it not, for
your own sake. I seek no other reward but that it may
please men and give you some ease in learning.<a href='#f12' class='c012'><sup>[12]</sup></a> Also,
sweet children, if there be in it any word that ye ken
not, speer<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c012'><sup>[13]</sup></a> while ye may, and when ye know it, bear
it in mind; and so by asking you may learn of wise
men. Also, think not too strangely that my pen
writes in this metre;<a href='#f12' class='c012'><sup>[12]</sup></a> for such verse is commonly
used, therefore take heed.</p>

<p class='c001'>And first of all, I think to show how you babies who
dwell in households, should ’have<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c012'><sup>[14]</sup></a> yourselves when ye
be set at meat, and how when men bid you be merry,
you should be ready with lovely, sweet and benign
words. In this, aid me, O Mary, Mother Revered;
and eke, O lady mine, Facetia,<a href='#f12' class='c012'><sup>[12]</sup></a> guide thou my pen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>and show unto me help. For as A is the first of all
letters, so art thou mother of all virtue. Have pity,
sweet lady, of my lack of wit, and though untaught
I speak of demeanour, support my ignorance with
thy goodly aid.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ah, “bele<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c012'><sup>[15]</sup></a> babees,” hearken now to my
lore.</p>

<p class='c001'>When you enter your lord’s place, say “God speed,”
and with humble cheer greet all who are there present.
Do not rush in rudely, but enter with head up and at
an easy pace, and kneel on one knee only to your lord
or sovereign, whichever he be.</p>

<p class='c001'>If any speak to you at your coming, look straight at
them with a steady eye, and give good ear to their
words while they be speaking; and see to it with all
your might that ye jangle<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c012'><sup>[16]</sup></a> not, nor let your eyes
wander about the house, but pay heed to what is said,
with blithe visage and diligent spirit. When ye answer,
ye shall be ready with what ye shall say, and speak
“things fructuous,”<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c012'><sup>[17]</sup></a> and give your reasons smoothly
in words that are gentle but compendious,<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c012'><sup>[18]</sup></a> for many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>words are right tedious to the wise man who listens;
therefore eschew them with diligence.</p>

<p class='c001'>Take no seat, but be ready to stand until you are
bidden to sit down. Keep your hands and feet at
rest; do not claw your flesh or lean against a post,
in the presence of your lord, or handle anything belonging
to the house.</p>

<p class='c001'>Make obeisance to your lord always when you answer;
otherwise, stand as still as a stone, unless he speak.</p>

<p class='c001'>Look with one accord that if ye see any person better
than yourself come in, ye go backwards anon and give
him place, and in nowise turn your face from him, as
far forth as you may.</p>

<p class='c001'>If you see your lord drinking, keep silence, without
loud laughter, chattering, whispering, joking or other
insolence.</p>

<p class='c001'>If he command you to sit in his presence, fulfil his
wish at once, and strive not with another about your
seat.</p>

<p class='c001'>When you are set down, tell no dishonest tale; eschew
also, with all your might, to be scornful; and let
your cheer be humble, blithe, and merry, not chiding
as if ye were ready for a fight.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>If you perceive that your better is pleased to commend
you, rise up anon and thank him heartily.</p>

<p class='c001'>If you see your lord and lady speaking of household
matters, leave them alone, for that is courtesy,
and interfere not with their doing; but be ready,
without feigning, to do your lord service, and so shall
you get a good name.</p>

<p class='c001'>Also, to fetch him drink, to hold the light when it is
time, and to do whatsoever ought to be done, look ye
be ready; for so shall ye full soon get a gentle name in
nurture. And if you should ask a boon of God, you
can desire no better thing than to be well-mannered.</p>

<p class='c001'>If your lord is pleased to offer you his own cup to
drink, rise when you take it, and receive it goodly with
both your hands, and when you have done, proffer it
to no man else, but render it again to him that brought
it, for in nowise should it be used commonly—so wise
men teach us.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now must I tell you shortly what you shall do at
noon when your lord goes to his meat. Be ready to
fetch him clear water, and some of you hold the towel
for him until he has done, and leave not until he be
set down, and ye have heard grace said. Stand before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>him until he bids you sit, and be always ready to serve
him with clean hands.</p>

<p class='c001'>When ye be set, keep your own knife clean and
sharp, that so ye may carve honestly<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c012'><sup>[19]</sup></a> your own
meat.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let courtesy and silence dwell with you, and tell
no foul tales to another.</p>

<p class='c001'>Cut your bread with your knife and break it not.
Lay a clean trencher<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c012'><sup>[20]</sup></a> before you, and when your
pottage is brought, take your spoon and eat quietly;
and do not leave your spoon in the dish, I pray
you.</p>

<p class='c001'>Look ye be not caught leaning on the table, and
keep clear of soiling the cloth.</p>

<p class='c001'>Do not hang your head over your dish, or in any
wise drink with full mouth.</p>

<p class='c001'>Keep from picking your nose, your teeth, your
nails at meal-time—so we are taught.</p>

<p class='c001'>Advise you against taking so muckle meat into your
mouth but that ye may right well answer when men
speak to you.</p>

<p class='c001'>When ye shall drink, wipe your mouth clean with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>cloth, and your hands also, so that you shall not in
any way soil the cup, for then shall none of your
companions be loth to drink with you.</p>

<p class='c001'>Likewise, do not touch the salt in the salt-cellar
with any meat; but lay salt honestly on your trencher,
for that is courtesy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Do not carry your knife to your mouth with food,
or hold the meat with your hands in any wise; and
also if divers good meats are brought to you, look that
with all courtesy ye assay of each; and if your dish be
taken away with its meat and another brought, courtesy
demands that ye shall let it go and not ask for it back
again.</p>

<p class='c001'>And if strangers be set at table with you, and
savoury meat be brought or sent to you, make them
good cheer with part of it, for certainly it is not
polite when others be present at meat with you, to
keep all that is brought you, and like churls vouchsafe
nothing to others.</p>

<p class='c001'>Do not cut your meat like field-men who have such
an appetite that they reck not in what wise, where or
when or how ungoodly they hack at their meat; but,
sweet children, have always your delight in courtesy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>and in gentleness, and eschew boisterousness with all
your might.</p>

<p class='c001'>When cheese is brought, have a clean trencher, on
which with a clean knife ye may cut it; and in your
feeding look ye appear goodly, and keep your tongue
from jangling, for so indeed shall ye deserve a name
for gentleness and good governance, and always advance
yourself in virtue.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the end of the meal is come, clean your knives,
and look you put them up where they ought to be,<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c012'><sup>[21]</sup></a> and
keep your seat until you have washed, for so wills
honesty.</p>

<p class='c001'>When ye have done, look then that ye rise up without
laughter or joking or boisterous word, and go to
your lord’s table, and there stand, and pass not from
him until grace be said and brought to an end.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then some of you should go for water, some hold
the cloth, some pour upon his hands.</p>

<p class='c001'>Other things I might commend you to do, but as
my time is brief, I put them not into this little report;
but overpass them, praying with a spirit that rejoices
in this labour, that no man abuse me; but where too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>little is, let him add more, and where too much, let
him take away, for though I would, time forbids that I
say more. Therefore I take my leave, and inscribe this
book to every wight whom it may please to correct it.</p>

<p class='c001'>And, sweet children, for love of whom I write, I
beseech you, with very loving heart, that you set your
delight upon knowing this book; and may Almighty
God that suffered bitter pains, make you so expert in
courtesy that through your nurture and your governance
you may advance yourselves to lasting bliss.</p>

necessary unto young children that must needs
learn the manner of courtesy.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>THE YOUNG CHILDREN’S BOOK</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_625 c011'>WHOSO will thrive must be courteous, and learn
    the virtues in his youth, or in his age he is outcast
among men. Clerks who know the Seven Sciences<a href='#f66' class='c012'><sup>[66]</sup></a>
say that Courtesy came from heaven when Gabriel
greeted our Lady and Elizabeth met with her; and
in it are included all virtues, as all vices in rudeness.</p>

<p class='c001'>Arise betimes from your bed, cross your breast and
your forehead, wash your hands and face, comb your
hair, and ask the grace of God to speed you in all your
works; then go to Mass and ask mercy for all your
trespasses. Say “Good morning” courteously to
whomsoever you meet by the way.</p>

<p class='c001'>When ye have done, break your fast with good meat
and drink, but before eating cross your mouth, your
diet will be the better for it. Then say your grace—it
occupies but little time—and thank the Lord Jesus for
your food and drink. Say also a <i>Pater Noster</i> and an
<i>Ave Maria</i> for the souls that lie in pain, and then go
labour as you are bound to do. Be not idle, for Holy
Scripture says to you of Christian faith that if you work,
you must eat what you get with your hands.<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c012'><sup>[67]</sup></a> A
man’s arms are for working as a bird’s wings for flying.</p>

<p class='c001'>Look you be true in word and deed, the better shall
you prosper; for truth never works a man shame, but
rather keeps him out of sin. The ways to Heaven are
twain, mercy and truth, say clerks; and he who will
come to the life of bliss, must not fail to walk therein.</p>

<p class='c001'>Make no promise save it be good, and then keep it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>with all your might, for every promise is a debt that
must not be remitted through falsehood.</p>

<p class='c001'>Love God and your neighbour, and thus may ye say
without fear or dread that you keep all the law.</p>

<p class='c001'>Uncalled go to no council, scorn not the poor, nor
hurt any man, learn of him that can teach you, be no
flatterer or scoffer, oppress not your servants, be not
proud, but meek and gentle, and always walk behind
your betters.</p>

<p class='c001'>When your better shows his will, be silent; and in
speaking to any man keep your hands and feet quiet,
and look up into his face, and be always courteous.</p>

<p class='c001'>Point not with your finger at anything, nor be lief<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c012'><sup>[68]</sup></a>
to tell tidings. If any man speak well of you or of
your friends, he must be thanked. Have few words and
wisely placed, for so may you win a good name.</p>

<p class='c001'>Use no swearing or falsehood in buying or selling,
else shall you be shamed at the last. Get your
money honestly, and keep out of debt and sin. Be
eager to please, and so live in peace and quiet.</p>

<p class='c001'>Advise you well of whom you speak, and when and
where and to whom.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>Whenever you come unto a door, say, “God be
here,” ere you go further, and speak courteously,
wherever you are, to sire or dame or their household.</p>

<p class='c001'>Stand, and sit not down to meat until you are told
by him that rules the hall; and do not change your
seat, but sit upright and mannerly where he bids, and
eat and drink and be fellowly, and share with him that
sits by you—thus teaches Dame Courtesy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Take your salt with a clean knife.</p>

<p class='c001'>Be cool of speech and quarrel not, nor backbite a
man who is away, but be glad to speak well of all.
Hear and see and say nothing, then shall ye not be
put to proof.</p>

<p class='c001'>Hold you pleased with the meat and drink set before
you, nor ask for better. Wipe your mouth before you
drink lest it foul the edge of the cup; and keep your
fingers, your lips and your chin clean, if you would
win a good name. When your meat is in your mouth,
do not drink or speak or laugh—Dame Courtesy forbids.
Praise your fare, wheresoever you be, for whether it be
good or bad it must be taken in good part.</p>

<p class='c001'>Whether you spit near or far, hold your hand before
your mouth to hide it.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Keep your knife clean and sharp, and cleanse it on
some cut bread, not on the cloth, I bid you; a
courteous man is careful of the cloth. Do not put
your spoon in the dish or on the edge of it, as the untaught
do, or make a noise when you sup as do boys.
Do not put the meat off your trencher into the dish,
but get a voider and empty it into that.</p>

<p class='c001'>When your better hands you a cup, take it with both
hands lest it fall, and drink yourself and set it by; and
if he speaks to you, doff your cap and bow your knee.</p>

<p class='c001'>Do not scratch yourself at the table so that men call
you a daw,<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c012'><sup>[69]</sup></a> nor wipe your nose or nostrils, else men
will say you are come of churls. Make neither the cat
nor the dog your fellow at the table. And do not
play with the spoon, or your trencher, or your knife;
but lead your life in cleanliness and honest manners.</p>

<p class='c001'>This book is made for young children that bide not
long at the school.<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c012'><sup>[70]</sup></a> It may soon be conned and
learned, and will make them good if they be bad. God
give them grace to be virtuous, for so may they thrive.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>HOW THE WISE MAN TAUGHT HIS SON</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_6_0_7 c011'>LISTEN, lordlings, and ye shall hear how the wise
man taught his son. Take good heed to this
matter and learn it if ye can, for this song was made
with good intent to make men true and steadfast, and
a thing well begun makes often a good ending.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was a wise man taught his son while he was
yet a child of tender years, meek and fair to look upon,
very eager for learning and with a great desire to all
goodness; and his father taught him well and featly
by good example and fair words.</p>

<p class='c001'>He said: “My son, take good heed every morning,
ere ye do worldly thing, lift up your heart to God, and
pray as devoutly as you can for grace to lead a good life,
and to escape sin both night and day, and that heaven’s
bliss may be your meed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And, my son, wherever you go, be not full of tales;
beware what you say, for your own tongue may be your
foe. If you say aught, take good heed where and to
whom, for a word spoken to-day may be repented
seven years after.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>“And, son, whatever manner of man ye be, give
yourself not to idleness, but busy yourself every day
according to your estate. Beware of rest and ease,
which things nourish sloth. Ever to be busy, more or
less, is a full good sign of honesty.<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c012'><sup>[110]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“And, son, I warn you also not to desire to bear
office, for then can it be no other than that you must
either displease and hurt your neighbours, or else forswear
yourself and not do as your office demands; and
get yourself, <i>maugré</i>,<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c012'><sup>[111]</sup></a> here and there, an hundredfold
more than thanks.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And, son, as far as you may, go on no evil quests,
nor bear false witness in any man’s matter. It were
better for you to be deaf and dumb than to enter
wrongfully into a quest. Think, son, on the dreadful
doom that God shall deem<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c012'><sup>[112]</sup></a> us at the last!</p>

<p class='c001'>“And, son, of another thing I warn you, on my
blessing take good heed of tavern-haunting, and of the
dice, and flee all lechery, lest you come to an evil end,
for it will lead astray all your wits and bring you into
great mischief.</p>

<div id='i044'  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i044.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c001'>“And, son, sit not up too long at even, or have late
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>suppers, though ye be strong and hale, for with such
outrage your health shall worsen. And of late walking
comes debate,<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c012'><sup>[113]</sup></a> and of sitting and drinking out of time,
therefore beware and go to bed betimes and wink.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And, son, if ye would have a wife, take her not for
her money, but inquire wisely of all her life, and give
good heed that she be meek, courteous and prudent,
even though she be poor; and such an one will do you
more good service in time of need, than a richer.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And if your wife be meek and good, and serve you
well and pleasantly, look ye be not so mad as to charge
her too grievously, but rule her with a fair hand and
easy, and cherish her for her good deeds. For a thing
unskilfully overdone makes needless grief to grow, and it
is better to have a meal’s meat of homely fare with peace
and quiet, than an hundred dishes with grudging and
much care. And therefore learn this well that if you
want a wife to your ease, take her never the more for
the riches she may have, though she might endow you
with lands.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And ye shall not displease your wife, nor call her
by no villainous names, for it is a shame to you to miscall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>a woman; and in so doing, ye are not wise, for if ye
defame your own wife, no wonder that another should
do so! Soft and fair will tame alike hart and hind,
buck and doe.</p>

<p class='c001'>“On the other hand, be not too hasty to fight or
chide, if thy wife come to you at any time with complaint
of man or child; and be not avenged till you
know the truth, for you might make a stir in the dark,
and afterwards it should rue you both.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And, son, if you be well at ease, and sit warm
among your neighbours, do not get new-fangled ideas,
or be hasty to change, or to flit;<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c012'><sup>[114]</sup></a> for if ye do, ye lack
wit and are unstable, and men will speak of it and say:
‘This fool can bide nowhere!’</p>

<p class='c001'>“And, son, the more goods you have, the rather bear
you meekly, and be humble, and boast not overmuch;
it is wasted, for by their boasting men know fools.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And look you pay well what you owe, and set no
great store by other riches, for death takes both high
and low, and then—farewell, all that there is! And
therefore do by my counsel, and take example from
other men, how little their goods avail them when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>they be dolven<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c012'><sup>[115]</sup></a> in their dens;<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c012'><sup>[116]</sup></a> and one that was
not of his kin hath his wife, and all that there is.<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c012'><sup>[117]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“Son, keep you from deadly sin, and assay to enter
Paradise. Make amends for your trespasses and deal
out of your goods to poor men, make friends of your
foes, and strive to gain salvation for your soul, for the
world is false and frail, and every day doth worsen.
Son, set nought by this world’s weal, for it fares as a
ripe cherry. And death is ever, I trow, the most certain
thing that is; and nothing is so uncertain as to
know the time thereof. Therefore, my son, think on
this, on all that I have said, and may Jesus, who for us
bare the crown of thorns, bring us to His bliss.”</p>

reckless, lewd and chattering like a jay, every man
refused me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now, good son, if I will teach, will you learn?

do after my teaching: pierce or bore with an auger or
gimlet, slanting upward, four fingers’ breadth from the

of the towel to the outer edge of the cloth, and so hold
the three ends together; then fold them all so that
there is a pleat at about a foot’s distance, and lay it fair
and smooth for your lord to wash after meat, if he will.
At the right side of the table, you must guide it along,
and the marshal must slip it further—the right side up
of all three cloths—and let it be drawn straight and
even, both in length and breadth; then raise the upper
part of the towel and lay it without wrinkling straight
to the other side so that half a yard or an ell hangs
down at each end, where the sewer<a href='#f129' class='c012'><sup>[129]</sup></a> may make a

<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>digne<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c012'><sup>[160]</sup></a> as royal blood, wherefore this prevails in
chamber and hall, for some day blood royal might
attain to the kingship.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If the parents of a pope or cardinal be still alive,
they must in no wise presume to be equal to their son,
either sitting or standing. The estate of their son
will not allow them either to sit or stand by him—nor
should they desire it; wherefore they should have a
separate chamber assigned to them.</p>

<p class='c001'>“A marshal must look to the birth of each estate,
and arrange officers such as chancellor, steward,
chamberlain, treasurer, according to their degree.</p>

<p class='c001'>“He must honour foreign visitors, and strangers to
this land, even when they are resident here. A well-trained
marshal should think beforehand how to place
strangers at the table, for if they show gentle cheer
and good manners, he thereby doth honour his lord
and bring praise to himself.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If the king send any messenger to your lord, if he
be a knight, squire, yeoman of the crown, groom, page
or child, receive him honourably as a baron, knight,
squire, yeoman or groom,<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c012'><sup>[161]</sup></a> and so forth, from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>highest degree to the lowest, for a king’s groom may
dine with a knight or a marshal.</p>

<p class='c001'>“A commendable marshal must also understand the
rank of all the worshipful officers of the commonalty of
this land, of shires, cities and boroughs—such must be
placed in due order, according to their rank.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The estate of a knight of [good] blood and wealth
is not the same as that of a simple and poor knight.
Also, the Mayor of Queenborough<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c012'><sup>[162]</sup></a> is not of like
dignity with the Mayor of London—nothing like of
degree; and they must on no account sit at the same
table.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The Abbot of Westminster is the highest in the
land, and the Abbot of Tintern the poorest; both are
abbots, yet Tintern shall neither sit nor stand with
Westminster.<a href='#f162' class='c012'><sup>[162]</sup></a> Also, the Prior of Dudley may in no
wise sit with the Prior of Canterbury.<a href='#f162' class='c012'><sup>[162]</sup></a> And remember,
as a general rule, that a prior who is a prelate
of a cathedral church, shall sit above any abbot or prior
of his own diocese, in church, chapel, chamber or hall.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Reverend doctors of twelve years’ standing shall
sit above those of nine years’, although the latter may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>spend more largely of fine red gold. Likewise, the
younger aldermen shall sit or stand below their elders,
and so in every craft, the master first, and then the
ex-warden.</p>

<p class='c001'>“All these points, with many more, belong to the
duty of a marshal; and so before every feast think
what estates shall sit in the hall, and reason with yourself
before your lord shall call upon you. If you are
in any doubt, go either to your lord or to the chief
officer, and then shall you do no wrong or prejudice
to any state; but set all according to their birth,
riches or dignity.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now, good son, I have shown you the courtesy of
the court, and how to manage in pantry, buttery,
cellar or in carving, as a sewer or as a marshal. I suppose
ye be sure in these sciences, which in my day I
learned with a royal prince, to whom I was usher
and also marshal.</p>

<p class='c001'>“All the officers I have mentioned have to obey me,
ever to fulfil my commandment when I call, for our
office is the chief in spicery and cellar, whether the
cook be lief or loth.<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c012'><sup>[163]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>“All these divers offices may be filled by a single
person, but the dignity of a prince requireth each
office to have its officer and a servant waiting on him.
Moreover, all must know their duties perfectly, for
doubt and fear are a hindrance in serving a lord and
pleasing his guests.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Fear not to serve a prince—God be his speed!
Take good heed to your duties, and be ever on the
watch, and thus doing as ye should, there will be no
need to doubt.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Tasting is done only for those of royal blood, as
pope, emperor, empress, cardinal, king, queen, prince,
archbishop, duke or earl—none other that I call to
remembrance. It is done for fear of poison, so let
each man in office keep his room secure and close his
safe,<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c012'><sup>[164]</sup></a> chest and storehouse for fear of conspiracy.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The steward and chamberlain of a prince of the
blood must know about homages, services and fewte;<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c012'><sup>[165]</sup></a>
and as they have the oversight of all other offices and
of the tasting, they must tell the marshal, sewer or
carver, how to do it; and he must be in no fear when
he tasteth.</p>

<p class='c001'>“As the evening draws in, and I cannot tarry, I do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>not propose to contrive more of this matter. This
treatise that I have entitled, if ye would prove it, I
myself assayed in youth, when I was young and lusty;
and I enjoyed these aforesaid matters, and took good
heed to learn. But crooked age hath now compelled
me to leave the court, so assay for yourself, my son,
and God speed you!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now, fair befall you, father, and blessings be on
you for thus teaching me! I shall dare to do diligent
service to divers dignitaries, where before I was afraid
for the scantiness of my knowledge; I perceive the
whole matter so perfectly that I am ready to try my
part, and some good I may learn from practice and
exercise. I am bound always to pray God reward you
for your gentle teaching of me!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now, good son, thyself and others that shall succeed
thee to note, learn and read over this book of
nurture, pray for the soul of John Russell, servant to
Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester. Pray for that peerless
prince, and for the souls of my wife and my father
and mother, unto Mary, Mother and Maid, that she
defend us from our foes, and bring us all to bliss when
we go hence. Amen.”</p>

<h3 class='c018'><span class='sc'>Necessary Rules to be Observed for the Guiding of Children in their Apparel and Otherwise</span></h3>

<p class='c019'>Let not children have their pleasures in the ordering
of their garments. Some delight to have them jagged
and cut; but such fantasticness ought to be reformed
by wiser and elder, considering their foolishness is beyond
measure, if all may be done at their pleasure; and
ancient writers repute them out of their wits and
madmen that favour it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, painted and gawdy apparel is not so fantastic
in children’s eyes; but as costly to the parents’ purses,
whereby ancient writers proclaim such parents fellow-fools
with their children.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>The modesty and decency of the vestments of children
are strong and good, not curious to the eye alone:
and such as are clean and without foulness or filthiness:
which after the estate and means of the parents ought
to be principal, so long as by the craftsman it be made
with reasonable and good form and fashion.</p>
<h3 class='c018'><span class='sc'>How to Order a Child in his Diet for Drink</span></h3>

<p class='c019'>For a child to make the beginning of his dinner
drink, is a good way to breed him up to drunkenness.
Especially, if he take it for wanton custom, and not for
necessity of thirst. It is dishonest to be suffered, and
annoysome to the health of the body of a child.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let not a child drink after he hath supped hot broth,
immediately upon it; much less, if he have been fed
with milk.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let not a child drink above twice or thrice at the
most at one meal, and that gently, and not without
reason: who bestoweth wine and beer on his child
beyond reason, deformeth and abuseth him more by
dishonouring his reason, and provoking him to an unreasonable
diet.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>
  <h3 class='c018'><span class='sc'>To Moderate the Appetite of a Child from Sauciness and being Liquorish</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Socrates being old, would not drink of the first cup;
for why? His brain was light, and the first drink is
ever the most fuming and overcoming.</p>

<p class='c001'>If thy child be set with his betters, let his hand be
last in the dish. And that he do it not at all, unless he
be first bidden. Neither suffer your children to put
their hands or fingers into broths, sauces, caudles, or
such like, at the table especially. Otherwise, let correction
bridle their wantonness.</p>

<p class='c001'>If he be of sensible years, let him forbear his fingers
in a dish, and use a knife without choosing at his
pleasure; for it is unseemly.</p>

<p class='c001'>Homer often reprehendeth sauciness in these or such-like
words. They boldly put their hands into the meat
that is set before them. And as it is unseemly to a
liquorish person to train his hands to every side of the
dish, so is it more vile to turn the best morsel towards
thyself.</p>

<p class='c001'>To gnaw bones belongeth chiefly to dogs, but it is a
civil thing to pick them clean with a knife.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>The licking of a dish belongeth to cats and dogs and
not to children nor men, be the relics never so sweet,
and betokeneth liquorishiness, not manners.</p>

<p class='c001'>To drink or speak with meat in the mouth, is uncivil
and dangerous withal.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let the children rise from the board when Nature
is sufficed, either by asking leave, or withdrawing
themselves.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let children bear away with them their trenchers,
saluting their parents, and first the chief in the company,
then the rest.</p>

<h3 class='c018'><span class='sc'>A Prayer to be Said by Children after they have Studied, at their Going to Bed</span></h3>

<p class='c019'>I give thee most humble and hearty thanks, O most
generous and blessed Father of Heaven, in that it hath
pleased Thee, of Thy most gracious goodness, to hear
my request. O Lord, still give me grace to go onward
in understanding and knowledge, that I may ever more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>praise Thy Holy Name, and grant me Thy grace to
amend my life, and to return unfeignedly unto Thy
service. And forasmuch as no creature can breathe
without Thy protection and favour, vouchsafe to extend
Thy mercies unto me this night, that I may peaceably
and quietly take that rest, which Thou hast appointed
for the refreshment of my body and mind, the night
and darkness being by Thy goodness ordained, as a
time convenient to take the same in, and to cease from
our bodily labours. And grant unto me (O Lord my
God) who of myself am neither able to lie down, nor
being laid able to rise up, Thy especial assistance and
help, that I may repose myself and receive (at Thy
merciful hands) sweet and comfortable rest, not according
to the greediness of corrupt nature, but as shall be
most expedient for the comfort and refreshing of my
wearied body and mind, that both may be strengthened
and enabled to go forward with that study and exercise,
which Thou hast ordained and appointed for me.
Lastly, grant me true repentance for my sins, bless and
defend, my parents, brethren, sisters, kinsfolk, neighbours,
and others, whom Thou would’st I should
commend to Thy fatherly protection, wheresoever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>they remain, and for the more true and zealous calling
unto Thee for these things, give me grace in faith to
say that prayer which Thy Son Jesus Christ hath
taught me, saying “O our Father which art in
Heaven,” &amp;c.</p>

“Learn or be lewd.” First printed by Dr. Furnivall.
Nothing is known of the author. Written in <i>rhyme royal</i>,
five-stress lines in seven-line stanzas, arranged ababbcc.
The treatise is noteworthy chiefly in that it seems to be
addressed to young princes, and the MS. dates from the
time when Edward V. and Richard of York were boys.
As it is more tedious than quaint in the original, it has
been rendered into prose.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_1'>1</a>. <i>Facet.</i> For author and title, see <i>Introduction</i>, p. <a href='#Page_xii'>xii</a>. It
was printed very frequently in the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries, both separately and in connection with seven
similar works, two of them also attributed to John Garland,
under the title: <i>Auctores Octo Opusculorum cum commentariis</i>,
&amp;c.; <i>Videlicet Cathonis</i>, <i>Theodoli</i>, <i>Faceti</i>, <i>Cartule alias de Contemptu
Mundi</i>, <i>Thobiadis</i>, <i>Parabolarum Alani</i>, <i>Fabularum Esopi</i>,
<i>Floreti</i>. The English author seems to have borrowed little
besides the name and the introduction,</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_2'>2</a>. <i>Babies.</i> Children much older than those we associate

“young man of good family.”</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_2'>2</a>. <i>Lady Facetia.</i> Apparently the author’s feminine
of Facetus (perhaps through confusion with <i>facetiæ</i>, jokes),
because courtesy was usually personified as a woman. In
the <i>Tesoretto</i>, the chief virtue is Larghezza (liberality), upon
whom Courtesy attends, together with Good-Faith and
Valour, over against the masculine qualities, Prudence,
Temperance, Fortitude, Justice.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_3'>3</a>. <i>Bele.</i> Fr. <i>belle</i>, beautiful. Not common in English

about 1450 (printed in <i>Queene Eliz. Achad.</i>). It is needless
to say that nothing of the sort is found in Aristotle; the
author is unknown. The introduction is in connected
alliterative verse (lacking in Harl. 5086, and expanded into
a generalised religious discourse in Harl. 1304).</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_10'>10</a>. <i>Elenge.</i> See N.E.D. on this rare word. Its two

(2) lonely, remote, combine to form a third meaning,
melancholy.</p>

<p class='c019'>MS. Cotton Caligula, A ii, fol. 88, 1446-60. Author
unknown. Apparently first printed by Dr. Furnivall.
The Duke of Norfolk, grandfather of Anne Boleyn and
Katherine Howard, was among the young henchmen at
the court of Edward IV., brought up on “the booke of
urbanitie.”</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_13'>13</a>. <i>Good manners</i>, &amp;c. William of Wykeham was more

<p class='c019'>MSS. Harl. 541, fol. 210, and Egerton 1995, about
1480. Sub-title <i>Edyllys be</i>. <i>Edyllys</i> may be the O. E. <i>æthele</i>,
German <i>edel</i>, meaning <i>noble</i>; but the sentence is then
incomplete. Ends “Quod Whytyng.” Whether he was
author or scribe I do not know, more probably the latter.
I have kept the rhyme in this version, because it is at once
shorter and more interesting than the other.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_16'>16</a>. <i>Seven Arts.</i> The quadrivium: arithmetic, music,
geometry, astronomy; and the trivium: grammar, rhetoric,
logic.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>p. <a href='#Page_16'>16</a>. <i>When Gabriel ... meet.</i> It is interesting to note
that a medieval writer connected courtesy with the worship
of Mary, even although he includes no precepts which
touch upon what we call chivalry to-day.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_16'>16</a>. <i>Villainy.</i> The French equivalent of churlishness;
what Russell calls “simple conditions.”</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>. <i>Beginning ... think.</i> This kind of rhyme, not
uncommon in the fifteenth century, seems to indicate a
pronunciation as in the cockney <i>nothink</i>.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>. <i>Mess.</i> Here <i>food</i>, but sometimes <i>table</i> (Latin
<i>mensa</i>), and again <i>group of people at a table</i>, as used still in
the expression “officers’ mess.”</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>. <i>Fault.</i> Text: that thy salt holds—which the
rhyme shows to be corrupt.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_18'>18</a>. <i>Work.</i> Text: keep—changed for the rhyme.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_18'>18</a>. <i>Fingers</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, not with thy knife? Or has a
negative been omitted?</p>

<i>Introduction</i>, p. <a href='#Page_xvi'>xvi</a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_19'>19</a>. <i>Behind no man’s back.</i> There was perhaps originally
an idea of greed, or, it may be, of possible tampering
with the drink, behind the prohibition.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_20'>20</a>. <i>Jill.</i> From Gillian, once a common name for
women.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_20'>20</a>. <i>The same.</i> Text: in same (German <i>zusammen</i>)
together.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_21'>21</a>. <i>Cumbered with no fiends.</i> This fear was very real in
the Middle Ages, and was fostered by such stories as <i>Robert

  <h3 id='n05' class='c018'>THE YOUNG CHILDREN’S BOOK</h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>MS. Ashmole 61 (Bodleian Library), fol. 20, about 1500.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_21'>21</a>. <i>Seven Sciences</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, knowledges, hence Arts. The
introduction is nearly identical, but very few of the
maxims agree.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_22'>22</a>. <i>What you get with your hands.</i> One of the many
allusions which suggest adaptation to the middle class.
Others are to buying and selling, to getting your money
honestly, &amp;c. The stress upon morals rather than manners
is perhaps due to the same cause.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_25'>25</a>. <i>At the school.</i> The inference seems to be that they
would learn manners there.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_25'>25</a>. <i>Quoth Kate.</i> The same name occurs at the end of
the three next poems as they appear in MS. Ashmole 61.
It is probably a corruption, unless we have here one of the
rare instances of a woman copyist. <i>Cato</i> suggests itself as
the most likely original; and in this way. He was undoubtedly
identified with the <i>Wise Man</i>, as appears from
the <i>Luytel Caton</i> of the Vernon MS. (see p. <a href='#Page_189'>189</a>, below).
Accordingly, <i>Quod Cato</i> might have stood at the end of this
poem, and have become confused with Kate from Katharine
or Catherine.</p>
<h3 id='n06' class='c018'>STANS PUER AD MENSAM</h3>

<p class='c019'>This must have been a popular form of the maxims, as
many MSS. still exist. The translation is made from
MS. Lambeth 853, fol. 150, about 1430, with occasional
references to Harl. 2251, fol. 153 (148), about 1460(?). A
much longer and more tedious (250 lines, instead of 99)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>version was printed by Dr. Furnivall in <i>Queene Eliz. Achad.</i>,
from MS. Ashmole 61. This last quotes <i>Grostum Caput</i>, <i>i.e.</i>,
Grossetete, and refers several times to “Dr. Palere,” of
whom nothing seems to be known. The Ashmole version,
however, contains several interesting points not mentioned

<i>The Northern Mother’s Blessing</i>. Written nine years before
the death of G. Chaucer. Together with it a short poem:
<i>The Way to Thrift</i>. This contains several different and
interesting stanzas.</p>

<p class='c001'>It begins:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“God would that every wife that dwelleth in this land,</div>

<p class='c001'>Another is:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The order of the stanzas is different from that here
printed.</p>

<p class='c001'>The rhyme-scheme is normally aabbccd; but the first,
second, seventeenth, and last stanzas are irregular—abcddc,
ababcdcdeef, aabbccdde, and aaaa, thus varying in both
number and arrangement of lines. The first four verses
contain roughly the same number of accents, the fifth and
sixth vary greatly in length, while the seventh is a constant
refrain to all stanzas except the first and last.</p>

<p class='c001'>The poem is distinctly popular in tone; and I have
seldom attempted to improve its rough metre, holding
that the effect is racier as it is.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>p. <a href='#Page_31'>31</a>. <i>Kirk.</i> Text has <i>church</i>, but the rhyme is <i>work</i>.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_32'>32</a>. <i>Thrive ... life.</i> The corresponding couplets are
usually proverbial in character.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_33'>33</a>. <i>Whatsoever he be.</i> Apparently on the basis that
“e’er a man is better than ne’er a man.”</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_33'>33</a>. <i>Atterling.</i> Literally, one who deals in poisons
(O. E. <i>ator</i>); hence, a witch; hence, a shrew.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_34'>34</a>. <i>Maze.</i> Without the help of the N.E.D., the
word is puzzling; but the context seems to demand <i>maze</i>,
connected with <i>amaze</i>, rather than <i>maze</i> = <i>labyrinth</i>.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_35'>35</a>. <i>Shooting at the cock.</i> The popular old English
pastime of throwing missiles to bring down a cock tied
by the leg.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_37'>37</a>. <i>Deed ... speed.</i> The meaning is that a deed finished
quickly helps on another by giving place to it.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_38'>38</a>. <i>Term-day.</i> Servants were hired by the year at
special times which varied according to the district, being
usually coincident with the big fairs of that part. Michaelmas
was a usual time.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_40'>40</a>. <i>As a wren hath veins.</i> The wren is so small that
but little blood can be let from her veins. Put more
strongly: “You cannot squeeze blood out of a stone.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Found in various MSS. The version in <i>The Babees’ Book</i>
is printed from Lambeth 853, fol. 186. Another is given
in <i>Queene Eliz. Achad.</i> from Ashmole 61, fol. 6. Ritson, in
his <i>Ancient Popular Poetry</i>, printed Harl. 4596, and Hazlitt,
in his <i>Early Popular Poetry</i>, MS. Camb. Ff. ll. <i>Luytel Caton</i></p>

<p class='c001'>It is doubtful whether this poem was written in imitation

old in virtues, sagacious in words,” &amp;c. Although I have
not been able to compare the different versions in detail,
I incline to believe that there are recognisable links between
them all. <i>The Good Wife</i> is, however, much the

<p class='c019'>First printed by Dr. Furnivall from MS. Harl. 4011,
fols. 171-89, dated about 1460. Other copies are in
Sloane 1315, fols. 49-67 and 2027, fols. 1-15b, supposed to
be slightly earlier in date; also, Royal 17 D xv., article 5.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nothing is known of the author beyond what he himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>says, that he was usher and marshal to Duke Humphrey
of Gloucester (regent during the minority of Henry VI.).
He was seemingly an old man and a widower before the
death of Duke Humphrey, who was murdered in 1447.
This seems to be suggested by the fact that he asks the
reader’s prayers for Duke Humphrey (as the King is prayed
for to-day) and then for the souls of his wife and his
parents. If then he was forced to retire from court by
old age (as he says in another place, see p. <a href='#Page_77'>77</a>, above)
some time before 1447, he might have been born even
before 1360, and studied his courtesy under Edward III.,
or at the very latest under Richard ll.</p>

<p class='c001'>The device of wandering in the country and there meeting
with some one who furnishes the subject of the poem was
extensively used by Chaucer and his school, derived by
them in turn from French poets of the thirteenth century.</p>

<p class='c001'>The long lines and pompous metre which he uses I have
employed occasionally, where the subject permitted that
form, to show the effect. The whole production done
that way would become insufferably tedious.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_49'>49</a>. “Is thy governance good?” Practically, “Do
you behave well?”</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_50'>50</a>. <i>Smooth and square the trenchers with.</i> At this time,
still made of stale wholemeal bread; later, of wood.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_51'>51</a>. <i>Linen clouts.</i> To stop up holes?</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_52'>52</a>. <i>Couleur de rose.</i> A red wine, classified under
malmsey (and therefore Greek?), mentioned in the <i>Interlude
of the Four Elements</i>.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_52'>52</a>. <i>New ale is wasteful</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, people can drink so much
of it because it is not intoxicating.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_52'>52</a>. <i>Stale drink.</i> Perhaps an allusion to the lead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>poisoning which is known to result from drinking ale
that has stood in a pewter pot for some time.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_52'>52</a>. <i>Cowche.</i> Any sort of cover. Used perhaps as
nowadays to lessen the noise and save the board.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_53'>53</a>. <i>Lay a second cloth.</i> I understand this to mean that
one linen cloth was not wide enough to cover the table
and to hang down sufficiently; hence, that two were used,
overlapping in the middle, and hanging down on each side.
By following the directions, literally, it is possible to see
what is meant. The <i>outer</i> edge, I take to be that nearest
the centre of the room, the <i>inner</i>, next to the wall.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_53'>53</a>. <i>State.</i> A fold or some other ornamental arrangement
of the table-cloth. The usher or sewer seems to have
twisted or curled it with his rod.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_53'>53</a>. <i>Put a towel round your neck.</i> The achievement described
in the following lines is quite possible, if the loaves
are small, and makes quite a “mannerly” appearance.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_54'>54</a>. <i>Rennes cloth.</i> Made at Rennes in Brittany, and
frequently mentioned in the romances.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_54'>54</a>. <i>Fold it lengthwise</i>, &amp;c. This performance was
possibly to give an appearance of cleanliness. The best
way to understand the process is to take a towel and try;
it is not so complicated as it sounds.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_55'>55</a>. <i>Surnape.</i> This again becomes simple by experiment.
The pleat or doubling about a foot from the end
of the table, is probably to avoid letting the long cloth
fall to the door. When the triple thickness of cloth has
been pushed and pulled across the table by the butler and
marshal, the pleat is smoothed out and the cloth hangs
from eighteen to thirty inches over each end.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_55'>55</a>. <i>Sewer.</i> Fr. <i>esculier</i>, Lat. <i>scutellarius</i>, whence also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>is derived <i>scullery</i>. The sewer’s office was practically to
bring and arrange the dishes.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_57'>57</a>. <i>Winking and watering.</i> More or less difficult in
the days of primitive chimneys, or no chimneys at all.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_60'>60</a>. <i>Upper crust.</i> In the old ovens, which were heated
by faggots withdrawn before the bread was put in, this
was even more distinctly the best part.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_60'>60</a>. <i>Carving of flesh</i>, &amp;c. This more properly belongs
in a book given over to recipes and the like, as the description
of the dishes is more interesting than the special
knack of serving each one.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_62'>62</a>. <i>Need not fear</i>, &amp;c. Almost the only suggestion of
any indignity in the service.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_63'>63</a>. <i>He ... and look you.</i> The change of person is
Russell’s.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_63'>63</a>. <i>As brown as a water-leech.</i> Is the allusion possibly
to shoes of dark-brown colour? Leeches are usually described
as black.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_65'>65</a>. <i>Bankers.</i> Translated <i>bench-covers</i>; but the context
suggests rather <i>bolsters</i>. The bench-covers were doubtless
cushions; hence the transition from the one meaning
to the other is easy.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_67'>67</a>. <i>By the license of his estate.</i> This seems to point to
a Sumptuary Law. In 1483, it was decreed that none under
the rank of a lord might wear cloth of gold, none under a
knight, velvet, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_67'>67</a>. <i>Wound.</i> A sort of turban?</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_67'>67</a>. <i>Paris-candle</i> or <i>percher</i>. A big candle of the sort
commonly used on altars.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_68'>68</a>. <i>Medicinable Bath.</i> A sort of Turkish bath with
herbs added. Some of those mentioned were known for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>their curative properties, even in Saxon times, as hollyhock,
mallow, centaury, fennel, heyriff, daisy, brooklime,
ribwort, flax, willow. Mallow was supposed to be good
for wounds. Wall pellitory contains nitrate of potash.
Fennel is still used as a home remedy. Heyhove is bitter
and aromatic, abounding in a principle similar to camphor.
Heyriff used to be applied externally for scurvy, and is said
to be still used in France (taken internally) for epilepsy.
Scabious was once thought valuable for various diseases,
primarily the itch, but also coughs, pleurisy, &amp;c. Danewort
was traditionally thought to have sprung up whenever
there had been an encounter between the English and the
Danes; it is a dwarf elder valued for its purgative properties.
Centaury was so named from the legend that by
it Chiron the Centaur was cured. It is gentianaceous and
valuable as a bitter. Herb-bennet, <i>herba benedicta</i>, the blessed
herb, was supposed to be particularly efficacious in keeping
away the devil. It was perhaps hemlock, or wild valerian.
St. John’s wort seems to have been a neutral element,
although it may have been added for some special reason.
Bresewort or bruisewort is the common daisy, once highly
valued for its general medicinal properties. Bugloss (text,
<i>bilgres</i>) was valued as a blood-purifier. Camomile is still
used in home medicine.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_70'>70</a>. <i>Mayor of Calais.</i> Because this was the one French
port that continued to be held by the English after the
Hundred Years’ War until the reign of Queen Mary. This
officer was also called “Mayor of the Staple,” because of the
wool-trade carried on through Calais. See p. <a href='#Page_71'>71</a>, above.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_71'>71</a>. <i>Golden royal rod.</i> A prince who was crowned in
his father’s life-time? In 1343, the Black Prince was invested
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>with a gold circlet and ring, and silver rod, by
Edward III.; so, likewise Henry V., in 1399, received a
coronet, ring and golden rod.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_72'>72</a>. <i>Bishop of Canterbury</i>, &amp;c. This means only that
neither archbishop had jurisdiction over the see of the
other.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_73'>73</a>. <i>Groom</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, receive each as if he were one degree
higher than his actual estate.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_74'>74</a>. <i>Queenborough.</i> A small port near the mouth of
the Thames, on the island of Sheppey.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_74'>74</a>. <i>Abbot of Westminster.</i> The yearly rental, as
quoted by Dr. Furnivall from <i>Valor Ecclesiarum</i> I., pp. 410-24,
was £4470, 0s. 2d.; of Tintern, £258, 5s. 10d. (<i>Val.
Ecc.</i> IV., 370-71).</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_74'>74</a>. <i>Prior of Dudley.</i> The value of this quoted by
Dr. Furnivall was £34, 1s. 4d. over against Canterbury at
£163, 1s. 9d. (<i>Val. Ecc.</i> III., pp. 4-5, and I., 27-32).</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_75'>75</a>. <i>Whether the cook be lief or loth.</i> A hint that the
cook was not always duly subordinate.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_78'>78</a>. “<i>Go forth, little book</i>,” &amp;c. The <i>Envoi</i> presents a
problem which at present I cannot solve. The question
is, how much of the “copy” here is the same as the
treatise used by Russell in his youth, and whether another
writer adds an <i>Envoi</i> explaining how he has improved
Russell’s work, while the latter is referring to a still
earlier work. There is every probability that Russell’s
own work ends with the request for prayers, which includes
the mention of the author’s name, and concludes
with <i>Amen</i>. And in support of this view is the fact that
neither of the Sloane MSS., which seem earlier than
the one translated, contains either the <i>Envoi</i> or Russell’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>name. As I have not studied the relation of the MSS.
I hesitate to conjecture; but from the facts at my disposal,
I think it probable that the writer of the <i>Envoi</i>
alludes to Russell as the “fore writer,” and casts the blame
for whatever faults may be found, upon the treatise on
which Russell himself declared his work to be based. It
would appear also that the writer of the <i>Envoi</i> did not
recognise Russell’s source. This may possibly have been
the <i>Book of Courtesy</i>, which (especially in its third book)
often corresponds to Russell. Moreover, as it was written
by a man who talked familiarly of John of Gaunt (see
p. <a href='#Page_112'>112</a>, above), who died in 1399, it agrees well enough
with the date of the book used by Russell in his youth;
but, needless to say, there is no proof that they were the
same.</p>
<h3 id='n10' class='c018'>THE BOOK OF COURTESY</h3>

<p class='c019'>MS. Sloane 1986, about 1460. The text is either very
corrupt, or the style is as rough as possible, lacking even
the essentials of grammar. It contains many Scotch words,
and has certainly suffered in its rhymes, and probably in
its sense through English copyists. The author apparently
remembered the institution of a custom at the court of
John of Gaunt; hence it seems likely that he wrote before
1420.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_81'>81</a>. <i>Bakes.</i> Perhaps rolls into a ball or moulds, as
this is a stage of baking.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_81'>81</a>. <i>Wallowing</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, rolling the morsel about.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_83'>83</a>. <i>Chare.</i> From the O. E. verb <i>to turn</i>; hence, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>turn either at play as here (trick) or at work, as in the
compound <i>charwoman</i>.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_85'>85</a>. <i>Cross-Christ thee speed.</i> The same oath occurs in
<i>Sir Gawayne and the Green Knight</i>, l. 762; but I do not
remember it elsewhere. The order of the first two words is
commonly <i>Christ-cross</i>, as in “Christ-cross-row” (alphabet).
The inversion is possibly a sign of translation from the
French.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_86'>86</a>. <i>On both knees.</i> So in <i>Liber Faceti</i>.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_88'>88</a>. <i>The adder.</i> “The nedder,” as the text puts it
quaintly, in the old, correct form. The serpent in <i>Genesis</i>.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_88'>88</a>. <i>Mysloset.</i> Apparently from the root <i>lose</i>; hence,
to lose amiss, <i>i.e.</i>, to lead astray; but the form appears
to be passive, not active. Perhaps the idea is that the
serpent himself was <i>lost</i> for his wickedness; but this seems
far-fetched.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_89'>89</a>. <i>Solace ... makes.</i> One of the many traces of Scotch.
The original rhyme must have been <i>mas</i>.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_90'>90</a>. <i>St. Ambrose.</i> Archbishop of Milan, 340-97.
He wrote an ethical treatise <i>De Officiis Ministrorum</i>, in
imitation of Cicero’s <i>De Officiis</i>; but whether or not this
injunction is found therein, it occurs in almost the same
words in <i>Liber Faceti</i>:—</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_90'>90</a>. <i>More and less.</i> If <i>at</i> means <i>that</i>, the sense is,
that everybody understands it; but the context seems to
call for the meaning: that you yourself do not fully
understand.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_92'>92</a>. <i>Three oxen</i>, &amp;c. Another proverbial voicing of
“Two’s company, three’s none.”</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_93'>93</a>. <i>Red man</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, red-haired. Presumably this distrust
of red-haired people as treacherous was based on the
old tradition that Judas was red-haired.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_93'>93</a>. <i>His courtesy</i>, &amp;c. The meaning is: he must needs
be discourteous who stirs fingers and toes, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_96'>96</a>. <i>Stocks with him.</i> Doubtless, because the castle
gate would be the most conspicuous place of punishment.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_96'>96</a>. <i>What he will deem.</i> What judgment he will pronounce
by law.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_96'>96</a>. <i>Wesselle clothes.</i> The meaning is not clear. Dr.
Furnivall suggests <i>vessel-cloths</i>; but the phrase is still doubtful
unless it alludes to ecclesiastical coverings, which,
however, would not be in the porter’s keeping, and which
would certainly not be sold. Possibly, <i>wassail-clothes</i>, <i>i.e.</i>,
garments kept perhaps for occasions of special revelry; or,
it may be, the sense is that the porter must keep a look-out
that vessels <i>and</i> clothes, in general, be not stolen and sold
by servants or others.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_96'>96</a>. <i>Sits with him</i>, &amp;c., <i>i.e.</i>, he chooses his own
companions.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_97'>97</a>. <i>Four pence apiece.</i> Dr. Furnivall found statutes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>against excessive prices, but no stipulation of the sum
mentioned. Perhaps it was the fixed price in the author’s
shire. It is cheap enough, only four shillings, at the outside.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_97'>97</a>. <i>Cupboard.</i> Probably that in which the canopies
and curtains were stored when not in use.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_98'>98</a>. <i>Liveries.</i> Not uniforms, but <i>deliveries</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, of
rations, or, as in this case, fuel for their own rooms.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_98'>98</a>. <i>Holly keen</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, it filled the fireplace like an
arbour from Good Friday until All Hallows Day.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_99'>99</a>. <i>On his yard score</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, make notes by a sort of
tally on the wood.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_99'>99</a>. <i>Six pence</i>, about five shillings to-day. According
to Russell, four ordinary persons made up a “mess.”</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_99'>99</a>. <i>The cause he has it in score</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, if the cook quarrels
about the expense, or the panter wants extra bread
(reward) brought on. In cases of dispute, the steward
was referred to.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_100'>100</a>. <i>Shall harbour</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, the marshal has charge of all
other officers, except the usher in the chamber. John
Russell combined the two functions.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_100'>100</a>. <i>Gentleman</i>, <i>yeoman-usher</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, two, of different
social standing.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_100'>100</a>. <i>Make litter.</i> The making of a pallet-bed I understand
as follows. The mattress is nine feet by seven,
made of loose straw, for the most part; but with a sort
of framework on all four sides, made of bundles (wisps)
of straw to keep the sides firm and the great mass of straw
in its place; and the whole is to be kept level. Text:
<i>On legh unsunken</i>, which seems to mean, not in hills and
dales.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_101'>101</a>. <i>As a man by the neck</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, the button was put into
a loop resembling a noose. The end of the line is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>clear. Perhaps (1) the man hangs light as the flesh drops
from his bones on the gallows; (2) the button hangs light
because it has no body; (3) the adjective was dragged in
for the rhyme.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_102'>102</a>. <i>Boards</i>, <i>trestles</i>, &amp;c. For the chamber only, as
I understand it, the hall having its own groom.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_104'>104</a>. <i>In strong stead</i> (text, <i>styd</i>) <i>on pallet he lay</i>. The
line is certainly corrupt, and I can make no sense of it.
From the context I gather that <i>lay</i> is the present optative
of the verb meaning to place, not the past tense of <i>lie</i>. <i>He</i>
seems to refer to the servant, as in the next line, and not
to the master who is already “winking.” In that case
<i>In</i> (Sc., <i>ane</i>?) <i>strong stead</i> must represent something that he
places on the pallet—what, I do not know.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_105'>105</a>. <i>Many are false.</i> So often in the romances of the

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_105'>105</a>. <i>Wax so green.</i> Seemingly the steward’s accounts
were kept first on tablets, and afterwards copied into books.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_106'>106</a>. <i>Surveyor.</i> His duty was to examine the dishes and
see that everything was right before it went to the table.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_112'>112</a>. <i>Duke John’s house.</i> As his father was king, the
man referred to must be John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster,
who died 1399.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_112'>112</a>. [<i>Wide</i>]. The passage seems corrupt. The text

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_118'>118</a>. <i>Starven.</i> Starved is still used, dialectically, to
mean, nearly dying of cold.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_119'>119</a>. <i>Will eat.</i> Russell, in his directions to the carver,
specifies choice bits, as the wings (first left, then right)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>of capon or hen; the legs of quail, lark or pigeon; of
fawn, kid, lamb, first the kidney, then the rib; shoulder,
then rib of pork, sides of rabbit or hare, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_119'>119</a>. <i>Lief and dear.</i> This seems to mean only that
he might, if he liked, keep a choice bit for a stranger.</p>

a middle-class boy in a cathedral school, who, as a chorister

<h3 id='n12' class='c018'>HUGH RHODES’S BOOK OF NURTURE</h3>

<p class='c019'><i>The Boke of Nurture, or School of Good Manners for Men,
Servants, and Children, with Stans Puer Ad Mensam, newly
corrected, being necessary for all youth and children.</i> The British
Museum contains three early editions, of 1550 [?], 1568,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>and 1577; and Dr. Furnivall mentions two others as
printed between 1551 and 1586.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is considerable difference between the editions of
1550 [?] and 1568, and that of 1577. H. Jackson, the
printer, or some unknown editor either worked from a
very imperfect copy or wilfully altered the meaning in
many cases; and further, broke up the long rhyming
couplets of the original into stanzas of four short lines,
the second and fourth rhyming. Naturally, the first and
third contain the greatest number of changes. I have used
the oldest edition, only modernising the spelling, herein
departing from Dr. Furnivall, who printed from that of 1577.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>The Book of Nurture</i>, which forms the main body of the
work, is preceded by <i>The Duties of Parents and Masters</i>,
<i>The Manner of Serving a Knight, Squire, or Gentleman</i>, and
<i>How to Order your Master’s Chamber at Night to Bedward</i>, all
in prose, and is followed by a poem <i>For the Waiting Servant</i>,
which I have omitted as more adapted to grown serving-men
than to children, and by various rules and maxims.</p>

<p class='c001'>From the colophon we learn that the author was Hugh
Rhodes of the King’s Chapel, who early in the poem
declares himself “born and bred in Devonshire,” as his
language showed. However, I can discover no traces of
dialect.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nothing further is known of him. The probabilities
are that he was Master of the chapel children, whose duty
it was to direct their singing, and generally look after
them and order their behaviour; but his name does not
seem to appear on any royal household list, as far as I
have observed.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_127'>127</a>. <i>Briefs and longs.</i> Expressed in musical terms,
perhaps because Rhodes was a music-master.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>p. <a href='#Page_128'>128</a>. <i>You ... thee ... thy.</i> These pronouns seem
throughout to be used indiscriminately, referring to the
same antecedent, and so I have retained them.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_135'>135</a>. <i>Phantasy.</i> Here <i>taste</i>, <i>inclination</i>. Obsolete. See
N.E.D., <i>Fantasy</i> 7.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_136'>136</a>. <i>Stick.</i> Probably toothpick. Erasmus wrote of
them twenty years before. Cf. <i>Introduction</i>, p. <a href='#Page_xxvii'>xxvii</a>. But
indeed we read in Old English of a “tooth-spear.”</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_138'>138</a>. <i>Checkmate.</i> Perhaps the meaning is: done for,
as far as manners are concerned. But later editions read
<i>Jack-mate</i>, of which the sense seems to be: that, you think
yourself as good as he, <i>i.e.</i>, your action shows too great
familiarity.</p>

<h3 class='c004'>FRANCIS SEAGER’S SCHOOL OF VIRTUE</h3>
<p class='c026'>The title continues: <i>and Book of Good Nurture for Children
and Youth to Learn their Duty by. Newly perused, corrected and
augmented by the first Auctor, F.S. With a brief declaration of
the duty of each degree.</i> Anno 1557, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c001'>This indicates plainly that there had been an earlier
edition. Seager was a poet and translator who flourished
1549-63. He seems to have come of a Devonshire family,
and was perhaps the Francis Nicholson, <i>alias</i> Seager, who
was made free of the Stationers’ Company in 1557. Among
other things, he translated from Alain Chartier, and also
made a rendering of the Psalms. His <i>School of Virtue</i> shows
as little originality as poetic merit, but it seems to have
been popular in his day and long after, as it was revised
by Robert Crowley and extended by Richard Weste during
the seventeenth century.</p>

  <h3 id='n14' class='c018'>RICHARD WESTE’S SCHOOL OF VIRTUE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>This was printed in 1619, and about fifty years later was
added to an edition of Seager, revised and extended by
Robert Crowley; hence, the sub-title, “the Second Part.”
Weste’s treatise is believed to be unique. Of its contents,
Dr. Furnivall published only <i>Demeanour in Serving at the
Table</i>, from Bensley’s reprint, 1817.</p>

<p class='c001'>p. <a href='#Page_161'>161</a>. <i>Gellius.</i> Flourished in the second century <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>,

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
